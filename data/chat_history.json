This event is being hosted by Husky Card Services and Residential Security, and will provide information and resources on topics like your Husky Card, access with the GET Mobile app, residence hall access, and guest policies.\n\nThe post mentions this is a great opportunity for students to \"build confidence and find resources for tricky situations\", so it seems to be focused on helping students prepare for various campus-related scenarios.\n\nWhile the Fall Fest event on September 2nd is not directly related to the Preparedness Day, the two events appear to be part of the broader programming and activities organized by the NU Sanskriti student group at Northeastern University.\n\nLet me know if you need any other details! The information provided in these posts seems quite comprehensive in answering your question about the Preparedness event.\n\n📚 **Sources** (5 relevant posts):\n1.
