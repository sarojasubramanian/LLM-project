    "content": "Based on the Instagram posts provided, here's what I can tell you about music auditions:\n\nThe first post (similarity score 0.66, 95% transcription confidence) announces fall auditions for the NU Sanskriti Music Ensemble. The auditions will be held on September 7, 2025 from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM and September 14, 2025 from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. The location is EV002 in the East Village Residence Hall. The post is looking for passionate musicians, both vocalists and instrumentalists, to join the ensemble. You can register for the auditions through the link in their bio.\n\nThe second post (similarity score 0.52, 95% transcription confidence) is about dance auditions for the NU Sanskriti Ghungroove group. While this is not directly about music auditions, it does provide some relevant context. The dance auditions will be held on September 12th and 13th, 2025 from 6:30 PM to 9 PM in the East Village 002 venue. They are looking for dancers across various styles like classical, Bollywood, Kathak, hip-hop, garba, kuthu, freestyle, and marath mol.\n\nUnfortunately, the third post (similarity score 0.31, 95% transcription confidence) is not directly relevant to music auditions. It's about a move-in concert happening at the International Village on August 28-29, 2024, featuring live music performances.\n\nOverall, the first two posts provide the most relevant information about upcoming music and dance auditions at Northeastern University. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!",

It covers topics like CAD, 3D printing, programming, and soldering, and includes the opportunity to build your own Elegoo robot. This seems to be an introductory robotics course or workshop, though the specific date and location are not provided.\n\nThe other posts do not appear to be directly related to robotics events. Post 2 (ID: 18288565693275995, Similarity: 0.37, Transcription confidence: 95.0%) is about a move-in concert at Northeastern University, and Post 3 (ID: 17973066548948932, Similarity: 0.34, Transcription confidence: 95.0%) is about a trip to Cambridge, but neither mentions any robotics-specific events.\n\nSo in summary, the only relevant event I can confidently identify from the provided information is the \"Intro Course\" mentioned in the first post. Unfortunately, the specific date, time, and location for this event are not included. If you need more details about this robotics course, I'd recommend reaching out to the organizers for additional information.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",
