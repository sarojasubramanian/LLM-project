It means bringing together ideas, evidence, and arguments from multiple texts to create a coherent discussion or an argument. It is different from simply summarizing one source after another; instead, it involves connecting, comparing, and contrasting sources to show relationships in building your own argument.\n\nIn this workshop, you will learn how to synthesize sources and why it is important in academic writing. We will also examine various synthesis matrices to build your source materials and understand the process of synthesis through examples.\n\n \n\nRegister here!",

In practice, this requires knowledge of the environment coupled with clever application of wiretap codes.  These codes are one-to-many mappings, where single messages are mapped to any of several codewords at random.  The sets of codewords that are assigned to a single message are cosets of a vector space.  This talk presents techniques for optimizing the design of the vector space (and, consequently, the cosets) for best-possible wiretap codes.  We show that for small parameters, the best codes tend to be old codes.\n\nBiography:    Dr. Willie Harrison received his BS/MS degrees from Utah State University in 2007, and his PhD from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2012.  He was an assistant professor at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs from 2012-2017, and he joined the faculty in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Brigham Young University in the fall of 2017, where he is currently an Associate Professor.  His research interests are in physical-layer security, wiretap code design, post-quantum cryptography, error-control coding, author identification, and sports analytics.",

    "description": "Following the success of last year's inaugural event, the Center for Emerging Markets (CEM) is excited to announce our second annual Undergraduate Case Competition on Emerging Markets on Saturday, October 18th, 2025.\n\n \n\nThis student-led competition will once again challenge Northeastern students to step beyond their coursework and tackle complex real-world business scenarios. Selected teams will have two days to analyze a case study focused on emerging markets, developing comprehensive strategies and solutions that address market dynamics, cultural considerations, and strategic implementation. They will then present to a distinguished panel of seasoned executives and industry leaders on the competition date. Winning teams from three initial rounds will advance to a final afternoon round.\n\n \n\nCEM's undergraduate case competition welcomes multidisciplinary teams, encouraging collaboration between students from all Northeastern colleges and schools. Students may organize themselves and apply as a four-person team, or apply as individuals to be matched with a team. This diversity of academic backgrounds consistently produces innovative approaches and unique insights that mirror the collaborative nature of global business.\n\n \n\nThe competition offers substantial cash prizes up to $1,500 and an opportunity for students to present their strategic thinking to senior business leaders, gain real-world consulting experience, and build networks within the global business community.",

    "description": "Join Northeastern's Gallery 360 for an artist workshop with Hannah Perrine Mode, an artist, educator, and researcher working at the intersections of art and environmental science. Working primarily between her native New England and her adopted homes in Alaska, Mode incorporates place-based making and cross-disciplinary exchange to deepen human connection to Earth systems and foster intersectional approaches to climate justice.\n\n \n\nMode will lead participants through a hands-on workshop to explore how scientific study and expression can foster care, curiosity, and community. Together, they will be guided by a central question: What can creative practices, close looking, and co-production teach us about caring for our environment, honoring the land and its histories (both human and ecologic), cultivating community care, and working towards social and environmental justice?\n\n \n\nFor the workshop, participants will create their own cyanotype prints using cuttings from the local landscape. After learning about Anna Atkins –  a 19th century cyanotype pioneer and botanist – the cyanotype process, and viewing Mode’s original cyanotype prints with plant cuttings and photo negatives, participants will collect materials from their surroundings and use them to create sun prints. They will print images of their cuttings to create abstract cyanotype prints to take home with them that act as records of their place, time, and human interaction with their environments. \n\n \n\nThis workshop is open to the public and presented in collaboration between Gallery 360 and City & Community Engagement.\n\n \n\nRegistration is required as space is limited.",

You will consider specific practices for each category, exploring how transparent and strategic AI-integration can enhance student engagement and success while addressing authentic learning challenges inherent to large format courses.\n\n \n\nThis session is only open to Northeastern University students, staff and educators.

In her new novel, The Wolf Hunt, the lives of an Israeli family based in the Silicon Valley are shattered after a terror attack on a local synagogue. The novel is an exploration of the fault lines in a community, a school, and a family, as an Israeli mother begins to suspect her teenage son of committing a terrible hate crime as revenge.\n\n \n\nWorking with terror victims in Israel after October 7, Ayelet Gundar-Goshen discovered that the same tools used by writers to create imaginary stories could be useful for people trying to survive a horrific, unimaginable reality. By turning a chaotic reality into a well-constructed story, by telling the story from beginning to end, the victims of trauma can create meaning and begin to heal.",

    "description": "Have you upgraded to a new phone or laptop? Did you know that a factory reset doesn’t completely wipe your old data? If a device contains any data or files, you need to destroy it in a safe and secure manner so that no one can access your old information and use it for malicious purposes. But how?\n \n\nThe annual Data Destruction Day is back! This event will be hosted on the Boston campus on Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025. At this event, students, faculty, and staff are invited to bring anything that holds data, including personal devices and paper materials, for safe and secure physical destruction.\n \n\nYes, that old laptop, smartphone, printer, or smart speaker is eligible! Simply bring your devices and paper files to the event and on-site staff will take care of the rest. This event ensures that your data cannot be recovered from old devices. As an added bonus, this is also an environmentally sustainable way to dispose of electronics!\n\nThis event is hosted as part of Northeastern's 2025 Cybersecurity Awareness Month plans.",

The piece went viral, establishing Vara as a leading voice in debates on creativity and emerging technologies. Her 2025 book Searches blends memoir, journalism, and the raw material of internet culture. Vara suggests that by harnessing the collective creativity that defines us, we might imagine a freer, more empowered relationship with our machines—and with one another.\n\n \n\nAll are welcome to attend this free online event. Students interested in the Mills College Creative Writing minor and/or currently enrolled in Mills College Creative Writing classes are especially welcome!",

Kaufman reimagines the oldest version of Robin Hood, the chaotic trickster found in the original ballads. Told through the eyes of one of Robin’s spies, a peasant girl named Jane, Kaufman’s novel explores voices rarely centered in historical fiction and weaves conversations about class, gender, the romanticization of war, and the dangerous allure of extremism into a deeply atmospheric, racing story. \n\n \n\nJoin the author for a conversation about how the medieval Robin Hood legend differs from our modern stories, the challenge of exploring the complicated roots of a beloved character, and what we can learn from morally gray heroes in the modern world. \n\n \n\n**This event is open to Northeastern community members only.",
